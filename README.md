COMP 470 Mobile Robotics
Course Description:

Prerequisite: COMP 350, COMP 362, MATH 240, or Consent of Instructor

Introduces students to the design, construction and programming of mobile robots. Included are traditional topics of robot architecture, sensors, actuators, robot kinematics and dynamics. In addition, topics such as adaptive control and human-robot interaction will also be studied. Students will have the opportunity to design and build their own robot and to program it to perform some useful task.

Student Learning Outcomes:

Apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering to the analysis and design of mobile robots.
Describe mobile robot kinematics and dynamics in a mathematical framework.
Identify and use different types of locomotion for mobile robots.
Describe the theoretical and practical aspects of various sensors and actuators.
Design and conduct experiments with mobile robots and to analyze and interpret data.
Work in a team-oriented, lab environment and present results in a professional manner.
